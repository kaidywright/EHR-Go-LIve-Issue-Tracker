 🏥 Hospital Software Implementation Plan (Agile Sprint)

## 🎯 Project Goal:
Improve patient safety and workflow efficiency by resolving barcode scanning and order visibility issues before hospital EHR go-live.

---

## 🔍 Identified Issues
- **Barcode scanners** not reading patient wristbands.
- **Orders** not visible in the nurse workflow.
- **Incomplete EHR data transfer** to the Medication Administration Record (MAR).
  
---

## 🧠 Agile Sprint Strategy
- **Sprint Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Team Roles:**
  - Scrum Master: Kaidy Wright (RN, CSM)
  - Clinical Analyst
  - EHR Integration Specialist
  - QA Tester
  - End-User Trainers

- **Tools:** Jira, GitHub, Zoom, Teams, EHR system (e.g., Epic, Cerner)

## 📌 Sprint Backlog Includes:
| Task | Assignee | Status | Priority |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Test barcode scanners in live environment | Clinical Analyst | To Do | High |
| Sync test patient data into EHR | EHR Integration Specialist | In Progress | Critical |
| Validate MAR data accuracy | QA Tester | To Do | Medium |
| Prepare end-user training guide | Scrum Master (RN) | To Do | High |

---

## 🚧 Risks + Mitigations
- **Scanner Malfunction:** Test with multiple models in real-world settings and ensure compatibility with hospital software.
- **Training Gap:** Provide real-time, on-site support during go-live and offer a detailed troubleshooting guide.
- **Data Integrity:** Conduct multiple rounds of testing with test patients before full-scale go-live. Validate data integrity at each stage of the EHR flow.
  
---

## ✅ Go-Live Checklist:
- [ ] Complete all sprint tasks, including QA validation.
- [ ] Conduct mock charting sessions with clinical staff.
- [ ] Validate patient and medication data flow from admission to discharge.
- [ ] Provide **at-the-elbow** support on Day 1 to ensure smooth transition for clinical users.
- [ ] Set up continuous feedback loop with nursing and IT teams for post-go-live issues.
  
---

## 📈 Metrics for Success:
- **Time-to-Completion:** Successful resolution of identified issues within sprint duration.
- **User Adoption:** Measure ease of transition and adoption rates of barcode scanning and new order workflows.
- **Post-Go-Live Support Feedback:** Gather feedback on scanner functionality and order visibility post-implementation.

# 🟦 Project 3: Client Launch Navigator – Agile Support Workflow (Smartsheet Scrum Board)

This project simulates how I, as a Project Coordinator, would manage the onboarding and go-live preparation for multiple SaaS clients using Agile principles inside Smartsheet.

I created a **Scrum-style board using Smartsheet’s Card View**, managing tasks across two sprints: Setup and Go-Live Prep. Each onboarding task is treated like a user story, with a status of **To Do → In Progress → Done**, tracked across clients like ZenCloud, Apex Energy, and HealthTech Co.

The board includes:
- Sprint assignments and client-specific task cards
- Status-driven swimlanes for visual progress tracking
- Priority, owner, and due dates on each card
- Notes to capture blockers or special needs

✅ All tasks were created in **Grid View**, then visualized in **Card View** as a functional Scrum board — reflecting my ability to plan, structure, and deliver coordinated rollouts across stakeholders.
